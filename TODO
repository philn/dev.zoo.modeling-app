- CI :)
- CI: Generate the various json source files (cargo-sources.json, cargo-wasm-sources.json)
- Ideally the logo should come from the kittycad install, but the current one isn't square, so I edited it in inkscape and bundled it here.
- Aim to reduce the amount of downstream WebKitGTK patches, ideally the WebKitGTK version from the GNOME runtime should be used and we shouldn't need a custom build here.
- Get rid of the `WEBKIT_DISABLE_SANDBOX_THIS_IS_DANGEROUS` hack in the app launcher script. See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=244002
- Proper offline building: Currently network is required because the Rust Flatpak extension cannot be used as-is (not including rustwasm).
- Move this repo either to Zoo's GH org, or Flathub org.
